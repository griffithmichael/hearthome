		<h3>Heart Home Privacy Policy</h3><br/>
		We here at Heart Home are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.<br/>

		This policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.  Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.

		<h4>Information We May Store and Collect From You</h4>

		</ul>

		<h4>IP Addresses</h4>
		We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.

		<h4>Cookies</h4>
		Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we put on your computer if you agree. These cookies allow us to distinguish you from other users of our website, which helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website. This also helps us to improve the way our website works, for example by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.

		<h4>Where we store your personal data</h4>
		The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the Canadian Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the CEA who work for us. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.<br/>

		All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.<br/>

		Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

			<li>To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so;</li>
			<li>To notify you about changes to our service.</li>
		</ul>	
		If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you.
